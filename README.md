# Median

## Sample code
This repository contains a file called `median.py`.  It contains code that asks the user to enter a list of numbers.  If the user enters a list of numbers, such as:
```
Enter a list of numbers separated by commas:
0, 0, 120, 234, 1
```
It prints out those numbers as a list:
```
[0.0, 0.0, 120.0, 234.0, 1.0]
```

## Assignment
Your assignment in this exercise is to change the code such that it returns the median of the list.

The median of a set of numbers is the middle number, that separates the lower half from the higher half.  The median of the following set of 7 numbers

1, 2, 3, **3**, 6, 10,12

is 3, because that is the middle number.  When the list contains an even number of values, the median is the arithmetic mean of the two middle numbers.  For example, the median of:

1, 2, **3**, **6**, 10, 12

is 4.5, because that is the arithmetic mean of 3 and 6,
